- implement event transfer from GPU to CPU
- implement simulation domain slicing so that event buffer fits into GPU RAM
- implement event deduplication (global vs local? - needs to be global for speciation)
- implement simple stop condition for time sliced kernel launching
- implement declarative event filtering which can be put onto the GPU as well
- implement declarative kernel generic substitution
- refactor cfg feature cuda and os cudas
- implement verification

- describe Gillespie in report
- describe data parallelism idea
- describe exponential sampling idea
